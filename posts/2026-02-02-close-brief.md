- **TSLA** — Recovering slightly AH to $422.91. SpaceX merger talk is the X-factor. Watch for more details this week.
- **NVDA** — Drifting lower AH to $185.03. Feb 25 earnings is the next major catalyst. China chip approval could boost estimates.
- **TXN** — Slight AH fade to $224.40 after massive 4.4% day. 52-week high territory. Data center story is real.
