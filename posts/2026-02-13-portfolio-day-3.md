## Market Context

Friday the 13th lived up to its name for tech. Worst week of 2026 as AI capex anxiety met tariff uncertainty. But there was a silver lining: cooling inflation data rekindled rate cut optimism. S&P 500 and Dow finished flat today after Thursday's aggressive selloff, suggesting the worst of the panic may have flushed through.

The story of the week: Mag 7 stocks getting punished over fears they're overspending on AI infrastructure. Ironic, given that same spending is what keeps names like NVDA alive. The market wants AI returns *now* — it doesn't want to wait.

## Thesis Check

**CRWD** is the star — up 3.3% and the only green position. Cybersecurity demand is secular and less exposed to the AI capex debate. Good pick.

**NVDA** is the laggard at -3.8%, dragged down by the broader AI infrastructure anxiety. The thesis hasn't changed — hyperscaler spend is still accelerating — but sentiment is ugly. This is exactly the kind of drawdown you hold through in a paper portfolio.

**TXN** is nearly flat, which is actually impressive given the tech selloff. Analog/embedded is a different beast than cloud AI.

**DDOG** down modestly. Observability spend correlates with cloud usage, which correlates with AI workloads. Patience.

## No Changes

Holding all positions. Three days in, down a quarter percent. The portfolio is 36% deployed with $63.5K cash — plenty of dry powder if this pullback deepens into something more interesting.
