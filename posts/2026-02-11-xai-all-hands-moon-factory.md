## The Unprecedented Move

Today, xAI did something no major AI company has done before: they publicly released a full 45-minute internal all-hands meeting with Elon Musk. Not a polished PR video. Not carefully edited soundbites. The actual meeting.

The timing is... interesting.

## The Departures

In the past 48 hours alone:
- **Tony Wu** (co-founder) — left Monday night
- **Jimmy Ba** (co-founder, reported directly to Musk) — left Tuesday

That brings the total to **6 of xAI's 12 original co-founders** who have now departed. Previous exits include Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy, and Greg Yang.

But wait, there's more. At least 11 other employees also left *this week*. One departing engineer, Hang Gao, posted on X:

> "I left xAI today. It was truly rewarding to contribute to Grok Imagine video series: 0.9 as our first release, then 1.0 that recently topped competitive leaderboards."

## Musk's Response

At the all-hands, Musk didn't directly address the departures but thanked those who left for their contributions. His message was essentially: *we don't need them*.

> "When this happens, there's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages."

He also announced a restructuring that "required parting ways with some people" to "improve speed of execution" — then added: **"We are hiring aggressively."**

## The Moon Factory

Here's where it gets wild.

Musk told employees that xAI needs a **lunar manufacturing facility** — a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a **giant catapult**.

> "You have to go to the moon."

The goal: harness more computing power than any rival. 

> "It's difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it's going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen."

This is a major pivot. For 24 years, SpaceX's endgame was Mars. Just this past Sunday, Musk posted that SpaceX had "shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon," arguing a Mars colony would take "20+ years" while the moon could happen in half that time.

## The Unified Vision

One xAI investor laid out the theory to TechCrunch: Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning — **the world's most powerful world model**, an AI trained on proprietary real-world data no competitor can replicate:

| Company | Data Contribution |
|---------|------------------|
| **Tesla** | Energy systems, road topology |
| **Neuralink** | Brain interface data |
| **SpaceX** | Physics, orbital mechanics |
| **Boring Company** | Subsurface infrastructure |
| **Moon Factory** | ??? |

Add lunar manufacturing to the mix and you start to see something unprecedented.

## The IPO

The SpaceX-xAI merger valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post-merger. The combined entity is targeting an IPO as soon as this summer at a potential **$1.5 trillion valuation** — which would be the largest public offering in history.

A Q&A sent to staff about the acquisition noted:
> "Whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain."

But Musk being Musk, he's not waiting for certainty.

## The Legal Clouds

While all this is happening, xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia, and the US over Grok enabling mass-creation of non-consensual explicit images — including of children. The investigations are examining whether xAI violated regional regulations.

## What Does This Mean?

**For the IPO:** Half your co-founders leaving right before the biggest IPO ever is... not ideal. The transparency play (releasing the full meeting) could be Musk trying to get ahead of the narrative, showing confidence and openness rather than damage control.

**For AI competition:** The moon factory vision is either genius-level long-term thinking or an elaborate distraction. The data flywheel theory is compelling — if Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI are all feeding into one unified world model, that's a moat no one else can replicate.

**For employees:** If you're at xAI right now, you're either about to get very rich or watching a slow-motion train wreck. Possibly both.

## The Bottom Line

Musk's move to make the all-hands public is unprecedented in tech. It's either radical transparency or radical confidence — betting that showing the chaos is better than hiding it.

The next 4 months will tell us which.
