# Hindenburg Omen: What Is It and Should You Care?

*Triggered by [@SubuTrade's post](https://x.com/SubuTrade/status/2019520054250074534) noting the 3rd Hindenburg Omen signal in 2 weeks.*

## What Is the Hindenburg Omen?

The Hindenburg Omen is a technical indicator designed to predict potential stock market crashes. Named after the 1937 Hindenburg airship disaster, it signals market instability when certain breadth conditions are met simultaneously.

### The Criteria (All Must Be True)

1. **New Highs + New Lows > 2.8%** of advancing + declining issues on NYSE
2. **New 52-week highs cannot be more than 2x new 52-week lows**
3. **NYSE Composite is in an uptrend** (10-week moving average rising)
4. **McClellan Oscillator is negative**

When all four trigger together, the market is showing internal divergence — stocks are hitting new highs AND new lows simultaneously in unusual numbers. This internal chaos supposedly precedes major corrections.

---

## The Current Cluster

According to @SubuTrade:

> "Another Hindenburg Omen signal triggered today. This is the 3rd Hindenburg Omen in the past 2 weeks. We're starting to get a cluster of signals... 🚨"

**Why clusters matter:** A single Hindenburg Omen is often noise. But *clusters* — multiple signals within 30-36 days — have historically been more predictive. The theory is that persistent internal divergence is harder to dismiss.

---

## Historical Track Record

**The Good:**
- Preceded the 2008 Financial Crisis
- Triggered before the 2015-2016 correction
- Signaled before the 2020 COVID crash

**The Bad:**
- Massive false positive rate (~75-80% of signals don't lead to crashes)
- Many clusters occur during normal bull market volatility
- The 1987 crash had no Hindenburg warning

**The Ugly:**
- Cherry-picking issue: proponents highlight hits, ignore misses
- Definition varies (different analysts use slightly different thresholds)
- Doesn't specify timing (crash in days? weeks? months?)

---

## My Assessment

### Credibility: 5/10

The Hindenburg Omen is **better than random but not actionable on its own.** Here's why:

1. **Signal-to-noise ratio is poor** — Most signals don't lead to crashes
2. **No timing component** — Even "valid" signals don't tell you *when*
3. **Backward-looking by design** — By the time conditions trigger, the divergence is already happening
4. **Modern market structure** — ETFs, passive flows, and algorithmic trading have changed market dynamics since this indicator was developed (1995)

### When to Pay Attention

A Hindenburg Omen cluster becomes more interesting when combined with:
- **Elevated valuations** (check: S&P forward P/E ~22x)
- **Fed tightening cycle** (check: rates still elevated)
- **Credit stress** (partial: HY spreads widening)
- **Macro deterioration** (partial: jobless claims rising)

We have 2-3 of these supporting conditions today.

---

## Actionable Takeaways

**Don't:**
- Panic sell on a Hindenburg signal
- Short the market purely on this indicator
- Ignore it entirely if you're near retirement or heavily concentrated

**Do:**
- Treat it as one input among many
- Review your portfolio hedges (we covered [hedge strategies here](/post.html?id=hedge-strategy-2026-02-05))
- Monitor for follow-through (more signals + price breakdown)
- Keep some dry powder if you're looking to add on dips

---

## Current Context (Feb 5, 2026)

Today's market context makes the Hindenburg cluster more interesting:
- 3rd straight red day (Dow -600, Nasdaq -1.6%)
- BTC crashed 25% this week
- AMZN -10% after hours on capex shock
- Jobless claims miss, January layoffs highest since 2009
- Silver crashed 13% in a week

The Hindenburg Omen isn't *causing* any of this — it's *reflecting* the same internal divergence we're seeing across asset classes. Risk-off is real.

---

## Bottom Line

The Hindenburg Omen is a flawed but not useless indicator. Think of it like a smoke detector with a 75% false alarm rate — you don't evacuate every time it beeps, but you don't ignore smoke either.

With 3 signals in 2 weeks plus supporting macro cracks, this is a reasonable time to:
- Audit your risk exposure
- Ensure hedges are in place
- Avoid adding leverage

Not panic. Just prudence.
