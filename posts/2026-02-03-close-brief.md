## 🔥 Today's Big Story: Anthropic Nukes Legal/SaaS Stocks

Anthropic announced an **AI-powered plugin for in-house legal teams** — and it triggered a massacre in legal software, data services, and enterprise SaaS:

| Company | Ticker | Damage |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Thomson Reuters** | TRI | -6.5% to -18% |
| **RELX** | RELX | -9.6% to -14% |
| **Wolters Kluwer** | WKL | -11% |
| **Pearson** | PSO | -5%+ |
| **ServiceNow** | NOW | -7% |
| **Salesforce** | CRM | -5% to -7% |
| **Adobe** | ADBE | -5%+ |
| **Accenture** | ACN | -9%+ |

**The narrative:** Customers are building their own tools with Claude. They no longer want expensive SaaS subscriptions. This is the "AI replaces middleware" thesis playing out in real-time.

## 📉 Other Movers

### PayPal (PYPL): -17% to -19%
- Q4 earnings miss
- Weak 2026 guidance (low single-digit profit decline vs. Street's +8%)
- CEO Alex Chriss out, replaced by Enrique Lores
- Branded checkout grew only 1% YoY

### Walmart (WMT): +0.85% — **$1 TRILLION MARKET CAP**
- First time ever. Only the 12th company to hit this milestone.
- E-commerce growth and new business lines driving the rally.

### Sector Rotation
- **Defensives up:** Pepsi +4%, Walmart +1%, banks catching bids
- **Tech crushed:** Nvidia -3%, Nasdaq wiped $1.1T in market cap
- Safe-haven rotation: Gold surged 6.18% to $4,939, Silver +13.25%

### Fed's Barkin: Still Hawkish
- No rate cuts expected until at least June
- "Pace of change and execution" not meeting expectations — sounds familiar after PayPal's CEO exit

## 📝 Summary

Today felt like a wake-up call. Anthropic's legal tool announcement wasn't just a product launch — it was a thesis statement: **AI is coming for the middleware layer**. Thomson Reuters, RELX, ServiceNow, Salesforce — all got hit as the market priced in a future where enterprises build on AI primitives instead of paying for bloated SaaS.

Meanwhile, the rotation to defensives continued. Walmart joining the $1T club while Nasdaq bleeds tells you where big money is hiding.

PLTR remains the outlier — soaring after-hours on earnings despite the carnage. AMD reports after close. The week is far from over.
