## AI Models & Research

### 🔥 xAI Founding Team Exodus
**Major news**: Half of xAI's co-founders have now left the company.
- **Tony Wu** departed Monday
- **Jimmy Ba** departed Tuesday
- Comes just after SpaceX acquired xAI for **$250B**
- Only 6 of 12 original founders remain

This is significant — xAI is bleeding talent right after the largest M&A in tech history.

### Zhipu GLM-5
- Chinese AI developer **Zhipu** is releasing **GLM-5**
- Designed to compete with DeepSeek
- Racing to beat DeepSeek's expected new model

### Karpathy GPT-in-200-Lines
@karpathy dropped a minimalist masterpiece:
- GPT training & inference in **200 lines of pure Python**
- No dependencies, just numpy
- "This is the *full* algorithmic content of what is needed. Everything else is just for efficiency."
- Also shared a powerful workflow: DeepWiki MCP + GitHub CLI to "rip out" specific functionality from any repo

## AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### Tesla Robotaxi — Fully Unsupervised
Per @aelluswamy: Unsupervised robotaxi rides now live in Austin. Videos show passengers in the backseat — no safety operator. The vision-only stack is working.

### OpenClaw on Lex Fridman
@levelsio RT'd: Lex Fridman interviewed Peter Steinberger (OpenClaw creator). The agent platform is going mainstream.

- **APP** (AppLovin) — reported, crushed $3.24 EPS

- **HIMS**: Down 10 days in a row, 11 weeks in a row, down 5 months in a row. "Even PayPal wasn't this bad."

## News

### Shutdown Watch 🚨
**85% odds** of another shutdown by Saturday Feb 14. The partial shutdown from late January just ended — now DHS funding is the sticking point. House on recess until next week makes timing tight.

### SpaceX-xAI Merger Fallout
The $250B merger is official but the talent exodus raises questions. Half the founding team gone in 3 years.

### Jobs Data (Yesterday)
- 130K jobs (beat 55K consensus)
- Unemployment: 4.3% (beat 4.4%)
- Wages: +0.4% MoM (above 0.3% est)

Labor market still resilient despite all the layoff headlines.

---

## Outlook

**CPI Friday the 13th** is the main event. Consensus expects 2.5% YoY (down from 2.7%) — if it prints hot, the "higher for longer" narrative strengthens and risk assets take another leg down.

**Near-term risks:**
- Shutdown drama (85% odds)
- Crypto capitulation (Fear/Greed at historic lows)
- xAI talent exodus (SpaceX integration issues?)

**Watching:**
- COIN earnings tonight
- Jobless claims at 8:30
- Fed speakers (Miran at 7PM)

The jobs beat yesterday was good news, but the market is laser-focused on tomorrow's CPI. SPY is 0.5% from all-time highs — we either break out or reject hard.
