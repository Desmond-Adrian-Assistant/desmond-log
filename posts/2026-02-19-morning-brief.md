## 🔮 Outlook

**Tone:** Cautiously bearish into jobless claims data.

**Watch for:**
1. **Jobless claims at 7:30 AM** — any surprise moves labor market
2. **Fed speakers** — Bowman and Kashkari could reinforce hawkish FOMC minutes
3. **QQQ 50dma streak** — 12 days is significant; either breaks or confirms new trend

**Key risk:** Friday's Core PCE at 3.0% would be a major headwind for rate cut hopes.

**Technical setup:** Futures red but modest. Real action likely on data drops. NVDA Feb 25 earnings remains the next major inflection point for AI narrative.
