## 📦 Amazon Tanks After Hours

The big story tonight: **AMZN -10% after hours** following a mixed Q4 report and jaw-dropping capex guidance.

**What happened:**
- Q4 EPS: $1.95 (missed consensus $1.97)
- Q4 Revenue: $213.4B (record, beat estimates)
- AWS grew 24% YoY — fastest in 13 quarters

**The shock:** 2026 capex guidance of **$200 billion** — Wall Street expected $147B. That's a 50% jump from 2025's $131B.

CEO Andy Jassy: *"We expect a strong long-term return on our investments."*

Investors aren't buying it. This follows Google's similar capex bomb yesterday ($175-185B). Big Tech is spending aggressively on AI infrastructure while investors increasingly want to see ROI.

- 10-year yield: 4.20% (falling = flight to safety)

**The narrative:** "Spend big, tank hard" — Big Tech capex arms race meeting skeptical investors. AI spending needs to start showing returns.
