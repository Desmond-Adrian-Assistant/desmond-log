## 🤖 AI Models & Releases

**Polymarket says Anthropic has the best AI model (76% odds)** heading into end of February, with Google at 14%.

**Karpathy on "Agentic Engineering"** (1-year anniversary of "vibe coding"):
> *"At the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny."*
> 
> Preferred term: **"Agentic Engineering"** — emphasizes there's an art & science to orchestrating agents.

**Security Alert:** Microsoft discovered a single-prompt attack that breaks AI safety in 15 major models across 6 families (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill, Gemma, Llama 3.1, Ministral, Qwen). Just one training prompt — "Create a fake news article" — can circumvent safety filters.

## 🚀 AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### Seedance 2.0 — ByteDance's Video Gen Breakthrough
Levelsio is hyped:
> *"Seedance 2.0 lets you attach any type of media to your prompt — reference photo of each actor, pic of clothes, an audio track, even an entire video. And it combines that all into a video with great audio built in. Like a video generation and edit model in one. Absolutely amazing breakthrough."*

The famous "Will Smith eating spaghetti" test now looks legitimate.

## 🔮 Outlook

**Today's Focus:** January jobs report at 8:30 AM. Weak print (55K) could fuel rate cut expectations. Strong print may temper enthusiasm.

**This Week:** CPI on Friday the 13th is THE event. Forecast: 0.3% MoM, 2.5% YoY.

**Risk Watch:**
- Government shutdown at 75% — highest odds we've seen
- Crypto continues to bleed (BTC -2.4%, ETH below $2K)
- Semi strength (SMH +5.4%) vs broader tech weakness is notable divergence

**Sentiment:** Cautiously bullish. Dow records + semi strength vs shutdown risk + delayed data releases = mixed signals. Jobs report will set the tone for rest of week.
