# Trump Accounts (Invest America): A Parent's Step-by-Step Guide

The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (Working Families Tax Cuts) created something genuinely new: **Trump Accounts**, officially called Invest America accounts. They're custodial-style traditional IRAs for minors — and they go live **July 5, 2026**.

I have two kids, ages 8 and 5. Here's everything I've learned and exactly what I'm doing.

## What Is a Trump Account?

A Trump Account is a tax-advantaged investment account for children under 18. The child owns the account; a parent or guardian administers it until the child turns 18, at which point it converts to a standard traditional IRA.

**The headline:** For children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028, the federal government deposits a **$1,000 seed contribution**. Treasury Secretary Bessent has noted that $1,000 invested at birth could grow to roughly **$500,000 by retirement** at historical market returns.

But even without the seed money, **any child under 18 with a Social Security number** can open one. That's the part most parents are missing.

## Eligibility: Who Gets the $1,000 Seed?

| | Trump Account | $1,000 Government Seed |
|---|---|---|
| Child under 18 with SSN | ✅ | ❌ (unless born 2025–2028) |
| Child born Jan 1, 2025 – Dec 31, 2028 | ✅ | ✅ |
| My 8-year-old (born 2017) | ✅ | ❌ |
| My 5-year-old (born 2020) | ✅ | ❌ |

**My kids don't get the $1,000 seed.** That's fine. The real value is the account itself — specifically the contribution limits and investment structure.

**Important:** Even for kids who don't qualify for the government seed, philanthropists, employers, family members, friends, and even states can contribute to any child's Trump Account. Those charitable contributions don't count toward the annual limit.

## How to Open a Trump Account: Step by Step

### Step 1: File Form 4547 with Your Tax Return
Check the box on **Form 4547** during your regular tax filing. That's it for the initial claim. Over 500,000 families had already filed as of late January 2026.

### Step 2: Treasury Administers the Initial Account
The U.S. Treasury sets up and manages the account initially. Your child's SSN is the identifier.

### Step 3: Roll Over to a Brokerage (Recommended)
Once the account is established, you can roll it over to **Fidelity**, Schwab, Vanguard, or another qualified custodian. I'd recommend Fidelity — their infrastructure for custodial accounts is mature and their index fund fees are at or below the 0.10% cap.

### Step 4: Fund It
Start contributing up to $5,000/year. Set up automatic monthly contributions ($416.67/month to max it out).

### Timeline
- **Now (Feb 2026):** File Form 4547 with your 2025 tax return
- **July 5, 2026:** Accounts go live; contributions can begin
- **July–December 2026:** Roll over to your preferred brokerage, set up auto-contributions

## Contribution Rules

| Source | Tax Treatment | Annual Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Individual contributions (parent, grandparent, etc.) | After-tax (not taxed on withdrawal) | Combined $5,000/year |
| Employer contributions | Pre-tax (taxed on withdrawal, like 401k) | Combined $5,000/year |
| Employee salary reduction | Pre-tax (payroll deduction) | Combined $5,000/year |
| Government seed ($1K) | N/A | Doesn't count toward $5K |
| Charitable / philanthropic | N/A | Doesn't count toward $5K |

**Key insight:** Individual (after-tax) contributions come out tax-free. Employer (pre-tax) contributions are taxed on withdrawal. If you have a choice, **individual after-tax contributions are better** — you get tax-free growth AND tax-free withdrawal on those dollars.

Check if your employer offers matching or contributions to Trump Accounts. If they do, take the match first, then fill the rest with after-tax personal contributions.

## Investment Options

This is one of the best parts: **you basically can't screw it up.**

Trump Accounts are limited to:
- **Low-cost index funds or ETFs** tracking the S&P 500 or other broad US equity indices
- **90%+ US companies** requirement
- **Expense ratio capped at 0.10%** (10 basis points)
- **No leverage** allowed

In practice, this means you're picking from funds like:

| Fund | Ticker | Expense Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Fidelity 500 Index Fund | FXAIX | 0.015% |
| Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index | FNILX | 0.00% |
| Vanguard S&P 500 ETF | VOO | 0.03% |
| SPDR S&P 500 ETF | SPY | 0.0945% |
| iShares Core S&P 500 ETF | IVV | 0.03% |

**My pick:** FXAIX or VOO. Set it and forget it for 10–18 years.

## The Math: Compound Growth Scenarios

Assuming **10% average annual return** (S&P 500 historical average) and **$5,000/year** contributions:

### My 8-Year-Old (10 Years of Contributions, Ages 8–17)

| Year | Annual Contribution | End-of-Year Balance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $5,000 | $5,500 |
| 5 | $5,000 | $33,578 |
| 10 | $5,000 | $87,656 |

**At 18: ~$87,656.** Then it becomes a traditional IRA and keeps compounding.

If they don't touch it until 65 (47 more years at 10%):
**~$87,656 × 1.10^47 = ~$7.2 million**

### My 5-Year-Old (13 Years of Contributions, Ages 5–17)

| Year | Annual Contribution | End-of-Year Balance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $5,000 | $5,500 |
| 5 | $5,000 | $33,578 |
| 10 | $5,000 | $87,656 |
| 13 | $5,000 | $130,613 |

**At 18: ~$130,613.**

If they don't touch it until 65 (47 more years at 10%):
**~$130,613 × 1.10^47 = ~$10.7 million**

### Conservative Scenario (7% Returns)

| Scenario | At Age 18 | At Age 65 (no more contributions) |
|---|---|---|
| 8-year-old, 10 years × $5K | $73,918 | ~$1.8M |
| 5-year-old, 13 years × $5K | $109,565 | ~$2.6M |

Even at conservative returns, this is transformational money.

## Trump Account vs Other Options

| Feature | Trump Account | 529 Plan | Custodial Roth IRA | UGMA/UTMA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tax on growth** | Tax-deferred | Tax-free | Tax-free | Taxed (kiddie tax) |
| **Tax on withdrawal** | Depends on contribution type | Tax-free (education) | Tax-free (after 59½) | Taxed |
| **Use restrictions** | IRA rules at 18 | Education only | Retirement (with exceptions) | None |
| **Contribution limit** | $5,000/year | Varies by state (~$300K+ lifetime) | $7,000/year (needs earned income) | No limit (gift tax rules apply) |
| **Requires earned income** | No | No | Yes | No |
| **Investment options** | S&P 500 index funds only | Varies | Anything | Anything |
| **Government seed** | Up to $1,000 (2025–2028 births) | No | No | No |
| **Withdrawals before 18** | No | Penalty if not for education | Contributions anytime | At custodian's discretion |

**The big advantage of Trump Accounts:** No earned income requirement. A 529 requires education expenses. A Roth IRA requires the child to have earned income. A Trump Account just requires a Social Security number.

**My strategy:** Max the Trump Account ($5K/year per kid), continue 529 contributions for college, and skip the custodial Roth (my kids don't have earned income yet).

## Background

Brad Gerstner (Altimeter Capital) helped design these accounts alongside the Trump administration and Michael Dell. The concept: give every American child a stake in the market from day one. Even for kids who miss the government seed, the structure — low fees, forced index investing, locked until 18 — is genuinely well-designed.

## Action Items

1. **Now:** File Form 4547 with your 2025 tax return (or amend if already filed)
2. **July 2026:** Roll over to Fidelity (or your preferred brokerage)
3. **July 2026:** Set up $416.67/month auto-contribution per child ($5,000/year)
4. **July 2026:** Pick FXAIX or VOO and enable dividend reinvestment
5. **Annually:** Confirm contribution hits $5,000; check for employer match programs
6. **At 18:** Evaluate Roth conversion — if the child is in a low tax bracket, convert the pre-tax portion to Roth
