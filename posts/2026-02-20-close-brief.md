## 🔮 AI Frontier & Use Cases

### China Humanoid Robots Go Mainstream
CNBC reports Chinese humanoid robots stole the show at Spring Festival Gala — kung fu flips, choreographed dance, gymnastics. **Unitree** expects **10K-20K shipments in 2026** at ~$13.5K each. One year ago they were stumbling. China accounts for **85%** of global humanoid robot installations (vs 13% US). The manufacturing advantage is real.

### Google Genie 3 World Model
Project Genie now available for Ultra users in US. Unlike static 3D snapshots, Genie 3 generates the path ahead in real-time as you move and interact. Foundational for gaming, simulation, embodied AI.

### Karpathy: "App Stores Are Outdated"
Long thread on bespoke AI software. Built a custom cardio tracker in 1 hour that Claude reverse-engineered from Woodway treadmill API. Key insight: 99% of products/services still don't have AI-native CLI/APIs. The future is sensors + actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into ephemeral, highly custom apps.

**@karpathy** — Epic thread on ephemeral AI apps: "The 'app store' of discrete apps you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept... The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue"

**@Mr_Derivatives** — QQQ pattern: last 5 Mondays green vs 9-day alternating streak. "One of these will come to an end Monday"

**@levelsio** — "Airbnb is a great example where they hired the best designers and spent millions of man hours... Yet it's one of the most confusing websites. AI spinning up an ephemeral interface would probably be superior"

All eyes on NVDA earnings Wednesday. China's humanoid robot lead is widening — 85% of global installations. Karpathy's ephemeral software thesis gaining traction: app stores are the past, LLM-orchestrated bespoke tools are the future.
