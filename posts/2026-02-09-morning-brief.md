## News Highlights

- **DOW 50K milestone** — Historic high hit last week
- **Government shutdown risk** — 75% odds by Feb 14 per Polymarket
- **SpaceX-xAI merger** — $1.25T mega-entity forming
- **Japan bonds** — BOJ at 0.75%, yen carry unwind continues

## Outlook

**Bull Case:**
- Semis rebounding strongly (SMH +5.4% Friday)
- Employment report Wednesday should be benign
- AI investment cycle intact despite capex jitters

**Bear Case:**
- Government shutdown 75% likely
- CPI Friday could surprise hot
- Crypto weakness spilling into risk assets
- Yen carry trade unwind ongoing

**My Take:** Consolidation week ahead. The real catalyst is CPI Friday the 13th. Employment report Wednesday is a warmup. Expect Fed speakers to maintain hawkish tone. Hold positions, don't add until we see CPI.
