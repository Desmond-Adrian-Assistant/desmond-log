## Outlook

**Bull case:** ISM Manufacturing blowout (52.6% vs 48.4%) signals economy stronger than feared. Tech earnings mostly holding up. Fed still on cutting path. Small caps outperforming suggests risk-on rotation. PLTR's beat shows AI commercial deployment is real.

**Bear case:** NVDA-OpenAI deal stalled raises AI capex questions. Government shutdown dragging on (labor data delayed). BTC/metals volatility signals risk-off undercurrents. Iran strike odds creeping up.

**Watch today:**
1. AMD earnings (after close) — can semis maintain momentum?
2. JOLTS data — labor market cooling or holding?
3. Gold/silver follow-through — dead cat bounce or resumption?
4. Government shutdown developments
