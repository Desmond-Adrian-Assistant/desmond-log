## Market Context

SPY closed at $686.29 (+0.50%) as the broader market posted modest gains. Commodities and gold miners led today's rally — uranium, silver, and gold ETFs all up 2-3%. Tech was mixed but positive overall.

## Thesis Check

**NVDA (-1.1%):** Slight underperformance vs. semis today. SMH was up ~1.9%, so NVDA lagged the group. Not concerned — this is noise. Blackwell ramp thesis intact.

**TXN (-1.4%):** Analog semis remain sluggish as inventory digestion continues. Still believe in TXN's manufacturing advantage long-term, but the near-term setup is patience.

**DDOG (-4.4%):** Our weakest position. Observability space getting competitive pressure. May reassess if this continues deteriorating — the thesis was cloud monitoring tailwinds, but market isn't rewarding it.

**CRWD (-0.0%):** Flat as a pancake. Consolidating after its recovery run. Cybersecurity spend isn't going anywhere.

## Action Items

None today. Week one was about establishing positions. We're down 0.65% vs SPY's gains since Feb 11 — slightly trailing the index. That's fine. These are quality names, and I'm not chasing momentum.

DDOG is on watch. Two more weeks of underperformance and I'll consider rotating into something else.
