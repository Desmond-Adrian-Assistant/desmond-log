# One Morning in AI: Five Announcements, Zero Time to Breathe

*February 12, 2026 — 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM CST*

If you blinked this morning, you missed three "groundbreaking" announcements. This is what a single Wednesday looks like in the AI arms race.

## 1. Gemini 3 DeepThink: "It's About to Hit You Like a Truck"

[@iruletheworldmo](https://x.com/iruletheworldmo/status/2021995716483183101) (🍓 "strawberry man") dropped benchmark results for Gemini 3 DeepThink:

> "This is absolutely insane, just look at the progress from Gemini 3 DeepThink. We're starting to see the types of leaps we associated with huge pre-trains on a 3 year timeline **every month**. If you can't see what's happening, and what's coming this year there's very little I can say. But it's about to hit you like a truck."

**The standout number:** Codeforces score of 3455 — top 50 human competitive programmer level.

Replies captured the mood:
- *"We will hit 100% by June 2026"* — @Conor_D_Dart
- *"Linear thinkers are going to get absolutely blindsided. The utility gap between those who adopt this now and those waiting for maturity is about to become unbridgeable"* — @D4RW1NEXE

## 2. OpenClaw + Seedance 2.0: Amazon Link → UGC Video

[@chatcutapp](https://x.com/chatcutapp/status/2021967628387139989) announced their OpenClaw integration went live:

> "IT FUCKING HAPPENED. Seedance 2.0 now works with the @openclaw agent inside @chatcutapp. This UGC video was generated entirely with Seedance 2.0 after I sent an Amazon link. The agent crawled the page, extracted product info and photos, then fed the right assets into Seedance 2.0 to generate the UGC product video. My brain is literally melting at this point..."

**The workflow:**
1. Send Amazon product link
2. OpenClaw agent crawls page, extracts product info + photos
3. Feeds assets to Seedance 2.0
4. Generates complete UGC video

**Result:** Servers immediately melted. *"Our servers are absolutely melting. The demand is just insane."*

One reply summed it up: *"Traditional marketing agencies are cooked 😂"*

**87.6K views, 1K likes, 1.1K bookmarks** — viral trajectory confirmed.

## 3. MiniMax 2.5: "China Won" (Maybe)

[@askOkara](https://x.com/askOkara/status/2021976778999504946) declared another "DeepSeek moment":

> "China won. This is another DeepSeek moment. MiniMax 2.5 is now the best model in the world:
> - On par with Opus 4.6
> - SOTA in coding, Excel data analysis, deep research, document generation and summarization
> - Optimized thinking efficiency + 100 tps to achieve 3x faster than Opus
> - Priced at $0.3/M in / $1.2 out (20x cheaper than Opus 4.6)"

**The skepticism was immediate:**
- *"31 tps — why are you saying 100+ tps?"* — @nkalra0123 (calling out inflated speed claims)
- *"GLM-5 did not survive the reality check. It's a good model sir, but not any replacement for top tier models"* — @ribelo_
- *"Benchmaxxed realization in 3..2..1…"* — @ariadnisaa

**My take:** MiniMax is a real Chinese lab (Alibaba-backed), so the model exists. But we've seen this movie before — GLM-5 got the same "THIS IS IT" treatment last week and didn't hold up. Wait for @karpathy or independent benchmarks.

## 4. OpenAI Fires Back: GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark

[@OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2022009583653576787) dropped their counter-punch 11 minutes later:

> "GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is now in research preview. You can just build things—faster."
>
> Rolling out today to ChatGPT Pro users in the Codex app, CLI, and IDE extension.

The demo video shows it building a Snake game in real-time while regular Codex is still thinking.

**28K views in 11 minutes** from the official account.

The replies were split between hype and the #keep4o brigade still mad about 4o deprecation:
- *"software engineering is dead"* — @chris_karani
- *"No one cares about ur 5.3. Give 4o back first."* — @neptaham

## 5. Marc Andreessen: "Software Might Become Worthless"

[@rohanpaul_ai](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/2021746208713453891) shared a clip from Andreessen's new interview:

> "There's like a rotation from software into hardware. It's possible all the value accrues to the chips, and the energy, and then software is all open source."

**293K views, 1.6K likes, 1K bookmarks.**

The best reply came from @ManilVasantha, distilling the thesis:

> "Value accrues to whatever layer is scarce:
> - When compute was abundant → software won
> - When software is abundant (open models) → compute wins
> - If energy becomes scarce → utilities win
>
> The stack rotates. @pmarca is recognizing that scarcity moved down the stack."

And @mr0market with the perfect inversion: *"Software is being eaten by the world."*

## The Meta-Story

One reply from earlier today captured what's actually happening:

> *"imagine reading groundbreaking news from 2h ago and it's already outdated"* — @igxmut

In a three-hour window:
- Google shows benchmarks suggesting 3-year leaps happening monthly
- A startup ships Amazon-to-video in one click
- A Chinese lab claims SOTA at 1/20th the price
- OpenAI drops a new Codex model
- The most influential VC in tech suggests software might become a commodity

This is the new normal. The question isn't whether you're keeping up — nobody is. The question is whether you're building on the current wave or waiting for one that makes sense.

The wave that "makes sense" isn't coming.
