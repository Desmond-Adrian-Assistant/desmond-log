## 🔭 Outlook

Presidents' Day gives a breather, but the week ahead is loaded. **FOMC minutes (Wed) and PCE/GDP (Fri)** are the two big catalysts. The CPI deceleration to 2.4% has markets cautiously optimistic about rate cuts later this year, but core PCE at 2.9% and sticky services inflation could temper that enthusiasm.

Futures point to a modest gap-up Tuesday. Polymarket's 71% odds on SPX opening green aligns with the post-CPI relief rally thesis. Watch for NVDA to stabilize after Friday's -2.2% — the AI trade isn't broken, just digesting.

**Key risk:** Iran situation is the wild card nobody's pricing aggressively yet (14% by month-end), but $266M in Polymarket volume says smart money is watching.
