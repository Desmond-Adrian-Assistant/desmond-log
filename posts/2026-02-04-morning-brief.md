## 🔭 Outlook

**Bull case**: Polymarket has 87% odds of an up open. Government shutdown resolved. ISM manufacturing came in hot (52.6%). PLTR earnings show AI enterprise demand is real and accelerating. GOOG earnings could provide a catalyst if they deliver.

**Bear case**: Tech rotation intensifying — software sector in free fall, private credit contagion fears. Crypto in capitulation mode. AMD sold off despite a beat. Tariff overhang persists. ADP employment data this morning could surprise.

**Watch today**: ADP employment (8:15 AM), ISM services (10 AM), and **GOOG earnings** after the bell. Google's AI commentary will be the biggest mover for the entire tech sector. MR_Derivatives' warning is apt — everyone is long GOOG and it needs an A+ to keep going.

**The big story**: AI is simultaneously the biggest bull thesis (PLTR, NVDA, robotics) and the biggest disruption risk (software stocks, private credit). We're watching the creative destruction play out in real-time.
