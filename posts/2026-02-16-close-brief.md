- **Karpathy angel investment**: Backed **Simile AI** — LLM population simulation engine. Instead of one personality, simulate diverse populations. Interesting unexplored dimension

## 🦾 AI Frontier (Use Cases)

### Humanoid Robots Steal the Show 🇨🇳
**Big story today**: China's Spring Festival Gala (CCTV's Super Bowl equivalent) featured humanoid robots from **four companies**: Unitree, Magiclab, Galbot, and Noetix. Partnerships valued at ~100M yuan ($14M).

- **Unitree** and **AgiBot** preparing for IPOs this year
- Last year: 16 Unitree humanoids dancing went viral. This year: even bigger production
- Chinese AI startups releasing frontier models during the 9-day Lunar New Year holiday
- @MR_Derivatives quote-tweeted Unitree's performance: "Wow."

This is the mainstreaming moment for humanoid robotics in China — 1.4 billion viewers.

## 🏆 Winners & Losers

**Winners:**
- 🥇 Humanoid robotics sector — massive visibility from CCTV gala
- 🥈 Gold miners — @eWhispers previewing big earnings week for precious metals
- 🥉 OpenAI — winning the narrative war after OpenClaw acquisition

**Losers:**
- 💀 Crypto — extreme fear, ETF outflows, Standard Chartered target slashes
- 📉 Anthropic — DMCA backlash + developer trust erosion
- 😰 Michael Burry shorts — PLTR still at $131 despite his 60% collapse thesis
